## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
The purpose of a method is to apply a task to all repeating tasks to simplify the process and creat less repeating code.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone(Sam)
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I think I have a good idea of how methods work its once they get more complex it could get confusing.
