## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
A hash organizes things by name and they are given a value usually.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store {brush: 33, food: 48, toys: 35, beds: 85}
p pet_store

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
states.keys
states.values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
We may use a hash keeping inventory. Hash would be better than an array because t can be change and edited freely from the outside.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
no questions
